		<h1>Rizal's Paintings</h1>
		<p>Jose RIzal was a great painter. He once demonstrated his talent for painting while in Dapitan. In 1894, Fr. Vicente<br>
            Balaguer thought of a backdrop for the Holy Week. He wanted one that’sdone in canvas oil painting. He heard of Rizal’s<br>
            painting ability and requested him to paint a beautiful backdrop for the church altar that would show a colonnaded court,<br>
            seen from a wide open gate like that of a scene depicting the court of Pontius Pilate. Fr. Balaguer sketched his idea<br>
            based from a church in Barcelona, Spain and after Rizal showed him his sketch, Rizal with the help of Sister Agustina<br>
            Montoya, a Filipina nun from Cavite who could paint, and Francisco Almirol, a native painter of Dapitan started the<br>
            difficult task of painting the scene in oil. The backdrop was a beautiful masterpiece and a prized possession to show off.<br>
            Senate President Manuel L. Quezon and General Leonard Wood, governor-general to Philippines were both impressed by the<br>
            painting. After Commonwealth, the painting was kept in the Ateneo de Manila Museum but fires and bombed destroyed it during<br>
            the World War II.

			<h1>CHRIST CRUCIFIED 1875</h1>
            <p>Material used: Crayon</p>
			<p>The crucifixion of Jesus in recorded in the New Testament books,<br>
                known as Gospels - Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. This Bible story<br>
                is the central summary of the saving Gospel of Jesus. Jesus had<br>
                prophesied of his death in Matthew “from that time on Jesus began<br>
                to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer<br>
                many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the<br>
                teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day<br>
                be raised to life.” Jesus understood that his life would be required<br>
                as sacrifice for the sins of man.</p>

            <p>Material used: Crayon</p>
			<p>These are shells painted by Rizal in Dapitan and given as a gift to Dona<br>
                Leonor Valenzuela and later passed into the hands of Dona Margarita<br>
                Valenzuela. Leonor Valenzuela is one of Rizal’s love interest. She is<br>
                a tall girl from Pagsanjan. Rizal sent her love notes written in invisible<br>
                ink. They could only be deciphered over the warmth of the lamp or candle.<br>
                He visited her on the eve of his departure to Spain and bade her a last<br>
                goodbye.</p>
