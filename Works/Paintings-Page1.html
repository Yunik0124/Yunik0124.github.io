		<h1>Rizal's Paintings</h1>
		<p>Jose RIzal was a great painter. He once demonstrated his talent for painting while in Dapitan. In 1894, Fr. Vicente<br>
            Balaguer thought of a backdrop for the Holy Week. He wanted one that’sdone in canvas oil painting. He heard of Rizal’s<br>
            painting ability and requested him to paint a beautiful backdrop for the church altar that would show a colonnaded court,<br>
            seen from a wide open gate like that of a scene depicting the court of Pontius Pilate. Fr. Balaguer sketched his idea<br>
            based from a church in Barcelona, Spain and after Rizal showed him his sketch, Rizal with the help of Sister Agustina<br>
            Montoya, a Filipina nun from Cavite who could paint, and Francisco Almirol, a native painter of Dapitan started the<br>
            difficult task of painting the scene in oil. The backdrop was a beautiful masterpiece and a prized possession to show off.<br>
            Senate President Manuel L. Quezon and General Leonard Wood, governor-general to Philippines were both impressed by the<br>
            painting. After Commonwealth, the painting was kept in the Ateneo de Manila Museum but fires and bombed destroyed it during<br>
            the World War II.

			<h1>SATURNINA RIZAL</h1>
            <p>Material used: Oil</p>
			<p>Saturnina was born in the year of 1850, and later died in the year 1913,<br>
                is the eldest child of Don Francisco and Teodora Alonso. She and her<br>
                mother provided the little Jose with good basic education that by the<br>
                age of three, Pepe already knew his alphabet. The first time Jose<br>
                experienced to ride in casco was when he and his father visited Saturnina<br>
                at the La Concordia College in Manila. Recent controversial story mentions<br>
                Saturnina as being with her mother when the latter allegedly tried to poison<br>
                Teodora Formoso, the wife Jose Alberto. The story further alleges that<br>
                Saturnina and her uncle Jose Alberto were the real parents of Soledad, the<br>
                supposed youngest sister of Jose. In 1909, Dona Saturnina published Pascual<br>
                Poblete’s Tagalog translation of the Noli Me Tangere. Jose Rizal, on the other<br>
                hand, immortalized his sister Neneng through the oil painting he made of her,<br>
                which is now housed in the Rizal Shrine in Fort Santiago.</p>

                Assistant Professor and was also one of the professors who handled and<br>
                interacted with Dr. Jose Rizal. One his letters dated the year 1884 Rizal<br>
