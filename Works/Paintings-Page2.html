		<h1>Rizal's Paintings</h1>
		<p>Jose RIzal was a great painter. He once demonstrated his talent for painting while in Dapitan. In 1894, Fr. Vicente<br>
            Balaguer thought of a backdrop for the Holy Week. He wanted one that’sdone in canvas oil painting. He heard of Rizal’s<br>
            painting ability and requested him to paint a beautiful backdrop for the church altar that would show a colonnaded court,<br>
            seen from a wide open gate like that of a scene depicting the court of Pontius Pilate. Fr. Balaguer sketched his idea<br>
            based from a church in Barcelona, Spain and after Rizal showed him his sketch, Rizal with the help of Sister Agustina<br>
            Montoya, a Filipina nun from Cavite who could paint, and Francisco Almirol, a native painter of Dapitan started the<br>
            difficult task of painting the scene in oil. The backdrop was a beautiful masterpiece and a prized possession to show off.<br>
            Senate President Manuel L. Quezon and General Leonard Wood, governor-general to Philippines were both impressed by the<br>
            painting. After Commonwealth, the painting was kept in the Ateneo de Manila Museum but fires and bombed destroyed it during<br>
            the World War II.

			<h1>IMMACULATE CONCEPTION 1974</h1>
            <p>Material used: Crayon</p>
			<p>The doctrine of the Roman Catholic asserts that Mary being the mother<br>
                of Jesus, was preserved free from the effects of the sin of Adam usually<br>
                referred to as “original sin” from the first instant of her conception.<br>
                Although various texts in both the Old and the New Testaments have been<br>
                cited in defense of the doctrine, it seems to have arisen from a general<br>
                acceptance in the early church of Mary’s holiness. Especially after Mary<br>
                had been solemnly declared to be the mother of God at the Council of<br>
                Ephesus in 431, mos theologians doubted that one who had been so close to<br>
                God could have actually experienced sinful acts. The great gift to Mary,<br>
                an ordinary human being just like us, was fitting because she destined to<br>
                be Mother of God. The purity and holiness of the Blessed Virgin Mary is a<br>
                model for all Christians.</p>

			<h1>A PAINTING ON A PAIR OF MOTHER PEARL</h1>
            <p>Material used: Oil</p>
			<p>These are shells painted by Rizal in Dapitan and given as<br>
                a gift to Dona Leonor Valenzuela and later passed into the<br>
                hands of Dona Margarita Valenzuela. Leonor Valenzuela is<br>
                one of Rizal’s love interest. She is a tall girl from<br>
                Pagsanjan. Rizal sent her love notes written in invisible<br>
                ink. They could only be deciphered over the warmth of the<br>
                lamp or candle. He visited her on the eve of his departure<br>
                to Spain and bade her a last goodbye.</p>
