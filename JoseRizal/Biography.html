		  <p class="while-living-in">
			While living in Europe, José Rizal wrote about the discrimination<br>
			that accompanied Spain&#39;s colonial rule of his country. He returned<br>
			to the Philippines in 1892 but was exiled due to his desire for<br>
			reform. Although he supported peaceful change, Rizal was<br> 
			convicted of sedition and executed on December 30, 1896 at<br>
			age 35.
		  </p>
		  <div class="text-wrapper-9">Early life</div>
		  <p class="on-june-jos">
			On June 19, 1861, José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso<br>
			Realonda was born in Calamba in the Philippines&#39; Laguna<br>
			Province. A brilliant student who became proficient in multiple<br>
			languages, José Rizal studied medicine in Manila. In 1882, he<br>
			traveled to Spain to complete his medical
			degree.
		  </p>
		  <div class="text-wrapper-4">Exile in the Philippines</div>
		  <p class="p">
			Rizal returned to the Philippines in 1892, feeling he needed to be<br>
			in the country to effect change. Although the reform society he<br>
			founded, the Liga Filipino (Philippine League), supported<br>
			non-violent action, Rizal was still exiled to Dapitan, on the island<br>
			of Mindanao. During the four years Rizal was in exile, he practiced<br>
			medicine and took on students.
		  </p>
		  <div class="text-wrapper-5">Rizal’s Lineage</div>
		  <p class="text-wrapper-6">
			The Rizal paternal ascendant was Domingo Lam-co, a full-blooded<br>
			Chinese who lived in Amoy, China and arrived in the Philippines<br>
			in the closing years of the 17th century. Domingo Lam-co was<br>
			married to a Chinese half-breed named Ines de la Rosa. The<br>
			Mercado-Rizal family had also Japanese, Spanish, Malay and<br>
			Negrito blood aside from their Chinese blood.
		  </p>

		  <p class="jose-rizal-s-father">
			Jose Rizal’s father Francisco was the youngest of 13 children of Juan and Cirila Mercado. He was born in
			Binan, Laguna, studied in San Jose College of Manila and died in Manila.<br />Teodora, the mother of Jose
			Rizal, was a business-minded, religious and hard working individual who was born in Santa Cruz, Manila on
			November 14, 1827. She was the second child of Brijida de Quintos and Lorenzo Alonso. Teodora had Spanish
			and Japanese ancestors while the father of Teodora was a half Spaniard engineer known as Lorenzo Alberto
			Alonzo. She studied at the Colegio de Santa Rosa. Teodora died in Manila in 1913.<br />The parents of Jose
			Rizal were both farmers who were granted by the Dominicans with the lease of a hacienda together with a
			rice farm.

		  <div class="text-wrapper-7">Rizal’s Siblings</div>
		  <p class="text-wrapper-8">
			Saturnina Rizal was the eldest of the offsprings of Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso Realonda. She
			married Manuel Hidalgo who hailed from Tanauan, Batangas. The only brother of Jose Rizal was Paciano Rizal
			and was the second child. Paciano studied at the San Jose College in Manila and worked as a farmer and
			later as a general of the Philippine Revolution. The other sisters of Jose Rizal were Narcisa,Olympia,
			Lucia, Maria, Concepcion, Josefa, Trinidad and Soledad. Soledad was the youngest child and later was
			married to Pantaleon Quintero.
